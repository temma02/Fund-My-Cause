## Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting a PR, ensure:

- [ ] Branch is based on latest `main`
- [ ] Commit messages follow Conventional Commits format
- [ ] Code follows project style (Rust: `cargo fmt`, TypeScript: `prettier`)
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] New tests added for new functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated (README, code comments, etc.)
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Snapshots updated if UI changed (`npm run test -- -u`)

## Running the Full Test Suite Locally

### Contracts (Rust)

```bash
# Build WASM
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Run all tests
cargo test --workspace

# Run tests with output
cargo test --workspace -- --nocapture

# Run specific test
cargo test --package crowdfund test_contribute -- --nocapture
```

### Frontend (TypeScript)

```bash
cd apps/interface

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

## Updating Snapshots

If you intentionally change a component's UI or contract behavior, update snapshots:

```bash
cd apps/interface

# Update Jest snapshots
npm test -- -u

# Or with Vitest
vitest -u
```

Commit updated snapshot files alongside your component changes so reviewers can see the visual diff.

## Development Setup

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fund-My-Cause/Fund-My-Cause.git
   cd Fund-My-Cause
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd apps/interface && npm install
   ```

3. Build contracts:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
   ```

4. Run tests:
   ```bash
   cargo test --workspace
   cd apps/interface && npm test
   ```

### Local Development

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd apps/interface
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

**Contracts:**
```bash
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo test --workspace -- --nocapture
```

## Changelog Maintenance

Every user-facing change must be recorded in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) before the PR is merged. This keeps the release history readable and makes it easy to generate release notes.

### Format

The changelog follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) conventions. Each entry lives under the `## [Unreleased]` heading until a release is cut, at which point it is moved to a new versioned section.

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- ...

### Changed
- ...

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- ...
```

### Semantic Versioning for Contracts

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) for both the npm packages and the Soroban smart contracts. The contract version is stored in `CONTRACT_VERSION` in `contracts/crowdfund/src/lib.rs`.

| Bump | When to use | Contract examples |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **MAJOR** (`x.0.0`) | Breaking change — existing callers must update | Removing or renaming a public function, changing a function's parameter types or order, changing storage key layout in a way that breaks existing data |
| **MINOR** (`0.x.0`) | Backwards-compatible new functionality | Adding a new contract function, adding an optional parameter, new error codes, new events |
| **PATCH** (`0.0.x`) | Backwards-compatible bug fixes | Fixing incorrect fee calculation, correcting an off-by-one in deadline validation, gas optimisations with no interface change |

> **Smart contract note:** Because deployed Soroban contracts are immutable, a MAJOR bump typically means deploying a new contract instance and migrating state or directing users to the new address. Treat any storage layout change as a breaking change.

### Changelog Categories

Use only the standard Keep a Changelog categories. Pick the one that best describes the change:

| Category | Use for |
|----------|---------|
| `Added` | New features, new contract functions, new API endpoints, new UI components |
| `Changed` | Changes to existing behaviour that are backwards-compatible (e.g. updated defaults, revised copy) |
| `Deprecated` | Features that still work but will be removed in a future release |
| `Removed` | Features or functions that have been deleted |
| `Fixed` | Bug fixes |
| `Security` | Vulnerability patches or security-hardening changes |

### Writing Good Entries

Each entry should be a single sentence that answers **what changed and why it matters to users or integrators**. Avoid implementation details unless they affect how the feature is used.

**Good entries:**

```markdown
### Added
- `accepted_tokens` whitelist parameter to `initialize()`, allowing campaigns
  to accept multiple Stellar tokens (e.g. XLM and USDC) simultaneously.
- `contributor_list(offset, limit)` function for paginated contributor queries
  (page size capped at 50 to prevent excessive memory usage).
- `pause` / `unpause` admin functions to temporarily halt contributions without
  cancelling the campaign.

### Changed
- `contribute()` now requires an explicit `token` argument; callers must pass
  the token address they are transferring.

### Fixed
- Platform fee calculation no longer rounds down to zero for contributions
  below 10,000 stroops.

### Security
- Added `checked_add` overflow protection to all contribution amount
  accumulations.
```

**Avoid vague entries like:**

```markdown
### Changed
- Updated some contract logic.
- Minor fixes.
```

### When to Update the Changelog

Update `CHANGELOG.md` in the **same commit or PR** as the code change. The PR checklist already includes a documentation step — treat the changelog as part of that.

- **Feature PR:** add an entry under `Added` (or `Changed` / `Deprecated` as appropriate).
- **Bug-fix PR:** add an entry under `Fixed`.
- **Security PR:** add an entry under `Security` and consider a coordinated disclosure before merging publicly.
- **Docs-only PR:** no changelog entry required unless the docs change affects how users integrate with the project.
- **Chore / tooling PR:** no changelog entry required.

### Cutting a Release

When the team decides to release:

1. Create a release branch: `git checkout -b release/v1.2.0`
2. In `CHANGELOG.md`, rename `## [Unreleased]` to `## [1.2.0] - YYYY-MM-DD` and add a fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` block above it.
3. Update the comparison links at the bottom of the file:
   ```markdown
   [Unreleased]: https://github.com/Fund-My-Cause/Fund-My-Cause/compare/v1.2.0...HEAD
   [1.2.0]: https://github.com/Fund-My-Cause/Fund-My-Cause/compare/v1.1.0...v1.2.0
   ```
4. Bump `CONTRACT_VERSION` in `contracts/crowdfund/src/lib.rs` if the contract changed.
5. Open a PR, get it reviewed, merge, then tag: `git tag v1.2.0 && git push --tags`.

### Automation

The following tools can reduce manual changelog work:

- **[git-cliff](https://git-cliff.org/)** — generates a changelog from Conventional Commit messages. Add a `cliff.toml` at the repo root to customise groupings and output format.
  ```bash
  # Preview what the next release changelog would look like
  git cliff --unreleased
  ```
- **[release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please)** — GitHub Action that opens a release PR automatically, bumping versions and updating the changelog based on commit history. Add `.github/workflows/release-please.yml` to enable it.
- **GitHub Releases** — paste the relevant changelog section into the GitHub Release description when tagging so users see it directly on the releases page.
